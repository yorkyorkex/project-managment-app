# Design Mode

Enter frontend prototyping mode where:

- Focus on visual design, layout, and user interface components
- Mock all data using dummy JSON or placeholder content
- Skip backend integration and API connections
- Use static data for demonstrations
- Prioritize rapid visual prototyping over functionality
- Create responsive designs with modern CSS/styling
- Implement interactive elements with basic state management
- Use placeholder images, text, and sample data

Perfect for quickly iterating on UI/UX concepts without backend complexity.
